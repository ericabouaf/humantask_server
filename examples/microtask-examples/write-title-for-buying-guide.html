    <h3 class="cml-blue"><strong>Article Title Guidelines</strong></h3>
<br>
<p><span class="cml-ruby">Below are the same guidelines as seen in the Writing Article Titles skills test. Please review as needed.</span></p>
  <ol>
        <li>Title must Be In Upper and Lower Case Letters With The First Letter of Each Major Word Capitalized.</li>
        <li>The article title must not be in all CAPS.</li>
        <li>No capitalized common words such as "a" - "the" - "to" - "for" etc.</li>
        <li>No quotes around the title.</li>
        <li>No period at the end of the title.</li>
        <li>Commas are allowed, but only in the middle of a title.</li>
        <li>All semicolons (;), long and medium dashes, and pipes (|) are to be replaced with colons (:), or changed to word equivalents.</li>
        <li>Parentheses () are allowed.</li>
        <li>Ampersands (&amp;) are not allowed, please use "and" instead. <span class="cml-orange"><strong>&lt;- NEW RULE!</strong></span></li>
        <li>No excessive repetitive punctuation in the title. </li>
        <li>No HTML tags of any kind in the title.</li>
        <li>No author name in the title.</li>
        <li>No URLs in the title.</li>
        <li>Title should be all-ages-appropriate (think "rated-G").</li>
        <li>Must not be keyword stuffed (too many redundant keywords used over and over again), but rather should read as a natural language title that any human could easily appreciate. </li>
        <li>Never put an article number in the title of an article.</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li>Example: [Wrong] Dog Grooming Tips-Article #3 </li>
        <li>Example: [Right] Dog Grooming Tips</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Never put a year or date in the title of an article. This greatly reduces the "shelf-life" and marketability of the article.</li>
        </ol>
<br>                            
        <h4>Article Title Tips</h4>
                    
        <p>The article title is more than just an accurate description about what the reader will find in the article body; it’s a promise made to build a trust relationship with the readership.</p>

        <p>Ask yourself: <em>"What does my article title promise to give to my reader?"</em></p>
        <ol>                
        <li>The article title should promise to deliver expert information on a specific topic. It should build interest or motivation.</li>
        <li>Within 2-5 seconds of anyone reading the article, they should be able to clearly see the answer to the promise you made in the article title.</li>
        <li>Do not bait or trick your reader into being forced to visit the article with a flashy but untrue title. This is a credibility and trust violation.</li>
        <li>Very short article titles should rarely be used. Instead, make them longer and more descriptive. The article title should never be a sales pitch. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Also, ask yourself: <em>"Does my article title entice the reader to ask a question?" E.g. "Why," "How," "Who," "Where," "When," etc.</em></p>

        <ol>                    
        <li>After reading the article title, a question should appear in the reader’s mind. This is a powerful concept because you’ve just engaged the mind of the reader, moving them from a passive to an active state. In the active state, your reader is more likely to find value in the content.</li>
        <li>Never underestimate the power of "How To" article titles. There is clearly a huge demand for articles that answer common problems in an easy-to-read "How To" format. But these titles should only be used when the content is actually of "How To" style.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>    <br>            
        <p class="cml-orange" style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Most importantly, always double-check spelling and word usage in the article title before submitting.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><em>* The above guidelines were adapted from <a href="http://media.ezinearticles.com/pdf/ezinearticles/training/full/article-title.pdf" target="_blank">Ezine's article title guidelines</a></em></span></p>

    <h3 class="cml-blue"><strong>Important Notes</strong></h3>
<p>Below are comments about questions we've been seeing from contributors that you should watch out for. <u>It's a bit nuanced, so please review carefully so you're properly rejecting bad questions</u></p>
    <div class="cml-section_body">
      <div class="row-fluid">
        <h5 class="cml-orange"><strong>Category name in the question</strong></h5>
          <p>As mentioned above, mentioning the category name itself in the question should be avoided. This is obviously being done in some particular categories (eg. Fitness Apparel, Baby Gear, Audiophiles). </p>
<p>This is disappointing, uncreative work that should be rejected. There are numerous subtopics/products/etc within these categories to write questions about. It's hard to imagine a real person going to a website and asking a question with the words "baby gear" in it.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of these unacceptable questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is baby gear made with such thin materials?</li>
<li>What is the best brand for baby gear?</li>
<li>What are some good special occasion gifts? (given category: special occasions)</li>
<li>What is the definition of bullion? (given category: bullion)</li>
<li>Are home renovations for kitchens cheap? (given category: home renovations)</li>
<li>Are portrait photography photos famous? (given category: portrait photography)</li>
</ul>

<br />
        <h5 class="cml-orange"><strong>Odd, unrealistic questions</strong></h5>
     <p>We're also seeing many questions that are simply pointless, unrealistic questions (many also happen to include the category name). Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are special occasion gifts suitable for other purposes?</li>
<li>Are tablets sold on a daily basis?</li>
<li>Can audiophiles be mistaken for something else? (given category: audiophiles)</li>
<li>Are luxury watches easy to purchase? (given category: luxury watches)</li> 
<li>Are home renovations for the best?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="cml-green">GOOD:</h4>

<ol>
<li>How do you select diamond grade? </li>

<li>What are popular gems for engagement rings besides a diamond?</li>
<li>How can I tell if a necklace is of good quality?</li>
<li>What are some of the different types of diamond cuts used in wedding rings?</li>
</ol>
<br />
<h4 class="cml-orange">BAD:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Is a carat the unit of measurement for diamonds?  (&lt;~ yes/no answer)</li>
<li>Is Walmart a good place to buy jewelry? (&lt;~ subjective answer and mentions a specific merchant business)</li>
<li>What do you think about sapphire? (&lt;~ subjective)</li>
<li>Do most brides prefer crystal or china for a bridal shower gift? (&lt;~ subjective)</li>
<li>How does one research buying a used car? (&lt;~ not in first person)</li>
<li>Where can I find smartphones? (&lt;~ "Where can I find" type question)</li>
<li>What's a good place to buy silverware? (&lt;~ "Where can I find" type question)</li>

    <h3 class="cml-ruby"><strong>Important Tips</strong></h3>

    <div class="cml-section_body">
      <div class="row-fluid">  
        <ol>
          <li style="list-style-type:none; font-weight:bold;">It's extremely important that the title accurately represents the content of the article. </li>
<ul>
<li>For example, "5 Tips on Buying a Washing Machine" might be a great-looking title, but it fails if the content doesn't contain five tips related to buying a washing machine.</li>
<li>As another example, "How to Extend the Life of My LCD TV" is a great title only if the article itself specifically discusses this.</li>
</ul>
          <li style="list-style-type:none; font-weight:bold;">Make sure to read the article <u><em><strong>thoroughly</strong></em></u>. </li>
<ul>
<li>The formatting on these articles isn't always great. For example, sometimes an article starts out with 10 products from that topic, then goes into buying advice in general, etc. If you read the article to the end, you'll best understand the overall topic.</li>
